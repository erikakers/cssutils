# CSSUtils

CSS utilities/modifier classes written in BEM style that I use on almost every
project. This project is also to force me from using heavy frameworks like
Bootstrap and Foundation.

Name isn't the great, bet I could come up with quickly. 

### Future Plans

This is very much still in active development, in the future I would like to
include grid system build around how I structure HTML files.
